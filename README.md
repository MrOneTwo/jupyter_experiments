## Outline

- clearly demonstrate how DFT/FFT works
  - explain the difficult parts
    - aliasing
    - leakage
    - ...

- data over sound
  - decode ggwave data - done but I'm not sure about the result. It's encoded using Reed Solomon
    error codes but I'm not sure if that just appends data for error fixing.

- FIR filters
